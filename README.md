# Ralph Loop AI Agent

This repository is for running Ralph Wiggum not only with claude code but also with your favorite ai agent.

> Ralph is a development methodology based on continuous AI agent loops. As Geoffrey Huntley describes it: "Ralph is a Bash loop" - a simple while true that repeatedly feeds an AI agent a prompt file, allowing it to iteratively improve its work until completion.
